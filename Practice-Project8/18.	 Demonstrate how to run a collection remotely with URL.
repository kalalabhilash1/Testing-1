To run a collection remotely with URL in Postman, you can follow these steps:

Create a collection in Postman. This collection will contain the requests that you want to run remotely.
Generate a public link for the collection. To do this, click the Share button next to the collection name and select Get public link.
Copy the collection link.
Run the collection on a remote machine. To do this, you can use Newman, the Postman command-line runner. Open a terminal window on the remote machine and navigate to the directory where Newman is installed.
Run the following command:
newman run <collection_link>
Replace <collection_link> with the public link for the collection that you generated in step 3.

Newman will run the collection on the remote machine and send the results back to your local machine. You can view the results in the Newman console.
