API chaining is the process of making multiple API calls in a sequence, where the output of one call is used as the input to the next call. This can be useful for automating complex workflows or performing data transformations.

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing APIs. REST APIs use HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

To perform API chaining in Postman, you can use the Pre-request Script tab to write a JavaScript function that will generate the request for the next call in the sequence. The function can use the output of the previous call as input.
API chaining is a powerful technique that can be used to automate complex workflows and perform data transformations. By using Postman's Collection Runner and Pre-request Script and Test Script tabs, you can easily create and execute API chains.

REST

REST APIs are designed to be stateless, meaning that each request should be independent of any previous requests. This makes REST APIs very scalable and easy to cache.

REST APIs also use a uniform interface, which means that the same HTTP verbs and headers are used for all operations. This makes REST APIs easy to learn and use.

Some examples of popular REST APIs include the Twitter API, the GitHub API, and the Google Maps API.

Benefits of using REST APIs

There are many benefits to using REST APIs, including:

Scalability: REST APIs are designed to be very scalable, meaning that they can handle a large number of requests without any problems.
Cachability: REST APIs are stateless, which means that responses can be cached by clients. This can improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.
Ease of use: REST APIs use a uniform interface, which makes them easy to learn and use.
Maturity: REST APIs are a mature technology with a large community of users and developers.
Conclusion

API chaining and REST are powerful techniques that can be used to automate complex workflows and perform data transformations. Postman is a great tool for creating and executing API chains and interacting with REST APIs.
