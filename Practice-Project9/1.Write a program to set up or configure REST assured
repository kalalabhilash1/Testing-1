SETUP OR CONFIGURE REST ASSURED

1. First, make sure you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.

2. Create a new Maven or Gradle project, or use an existing one.

3. Open your project's build file (pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle).

4. Add the REST Assured dependency to your project. For Maven, add the following dependency to the `<dependencies>` section:

xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
    <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
    <version>4.4.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>


For Gradle, add the following dependency to the `dependencies` block:

groovy
testImplementation 'io.rest-assured:rest-assured:4.4.0'


5. Save the build file and let your build tool resolve the dependencies.

6. Now, you're ready to start writing your REST Assured tests! Create a new Java class or update an existing one.

7. Import the necessary REST Assured classes at the top of your Java file:

java
import static io.restassured.RestAssured.*;
import static io.restassured.matcher.RestAssuredMatchers.*;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;


8. You can now use REST Assured's fluent API to write your tests. For example, you can send HTTP requests, validate responses, and extract data from the response.

9. Run your tests and verify that they are working as expected.

That's it! You have successfully set up and configured REST Assured in your project. Happy testing! Let me know if you have any further questions or need more assistance.
