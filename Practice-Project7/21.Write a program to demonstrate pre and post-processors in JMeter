Pre-processors in JMeter
Pre-processors in JMeter are executed before the sampler is executed. They can be used to modify the sampler request or to prepare the environment for the sampler.

Some examples of pre-processors include:

HTTP Cookie Manager: This pre-processor allows you to manage cookies for your HTTP sampler requests.
CSV Data Set Reader: This pre-processor allows you to read data from a CSV file and use the data to populate variables that can be used in your sampler requests.
Regular Expression Extractor: This pre-processor allows you to extract values from a sampler response using regular expressions. The extracted values can be stored in variables that can be used in subsequent samplers.
Post-processors in JMeter
Post-processors in JMeter are executed after the sampler is executed. They can be used to process the sampler response or to store the results.

Some examples of post-processors include:

Assertion: This post-processor allows you to assert that the sampler response meets certain criteria.
BeanShell Sampler: This post-processor allows you to execute custom Java code on the sampler response.
JDBC Post Processor: This post-processor allows you to store the sampler results in a JDBC database.
