The Interleave Controller in JMeter is a controller that allows you to execute multiple samplers in an interleaved fashion. 
This means that the controller will execute each sampler once,
then it will start over and execute each sampler again, and so on.

To use the Interleave Controller,
simply add it to your JMeter Test Plan and then add the samplers that you want to interleave under the Interleave Controller node.
You can also add other controllers under the Interleave Controller node, 
such as Loop Controllers and Random Controllers.
