To demonstrate random timers in JMeter, you can use the following steps:

Constant Timer:

Add a Constant Timer to the sampler that you want to add the timer to.
Configure the Constant Timer by entering the delay in milliseconds.
Run the test.
Gaussian Timer:

Add a Gaussian Timer to the sampler that you want to add the timer to.
Configure the Gaussian Timer by entering the mean and standard deviation in milliseconds.
Run the test.
Poison Timer:

Add a Poison Timer to the sampler that you want to add the timer to.
Configure the Poison Timer by entering the rate in milliseconds.
Run the test.
