Feature: Shopping Cart

  Scenario: Add item to cart
    Given I am on the product page
    When I click on the "Add to Cart" button for a product
    Then the item should be added to my shopping cart

  Scenario: Remove item from cart
    Given I have items in my shopping cart
    When I click on the "Remove" button for an item
    Then the item should be removed from my shopping cart
In this example, we have two scenarios: "Add item to cart" and "Remove item from cart".
Each scenario starts with the `Scenario:` keyword followed by a descriptive name. 
The steps for each scenario are written using Given-When-Then format.
