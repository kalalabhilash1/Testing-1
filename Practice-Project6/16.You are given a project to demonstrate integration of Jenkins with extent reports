To integrate Jenkins with Extent Reports, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Extent Reports plugin in your Jenkins instance.
You can do this by navigating to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" and searching for "Extent Reports" in the available plugins section.
Install and restart Jenkins if required.

2. Configure your Jenkins job to generate Extent Reports. 
In your Jenkins job configuration, add a post-build action to "Publish Extent Reports".
Specify the path to your Extent Reports HTML file or directory containing the reports.

3. Build your Jenkins job. Once the job is executed, the Extent Reports plugin will parse the reports and display them in the Jenkins job's build page.

4. Access the Extent Reports in Jenkins.
After the job is built, you can navigate to the job's build page and click on the "Extent Reports" link to view the generated reports.
