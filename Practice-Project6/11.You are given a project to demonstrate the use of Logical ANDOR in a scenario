Scenario: Login with valid credentials
  Given I am on the login page
  When I enter a valid username
  And I enter a valid password
  And I click on the "Login" button
  Then I should be logged in successfully

Scenario: Login with invalid credentials
  Given I am on the login page
  When I enter an invalid username
  Or I enter an invalid password
  And I click on the "Login" button
  Then I should see an error message


In the first scenario, we use the logical AND (`And`) to specify multiple steps that need to be performed in sequence. Each step is dependent on the previous step.

In the second scenario, we use the logical OR (`Or`) to specify alternative steps. Either entering an invalid username or entering an invalid password will trigger the same outcome.

By using logical AND and OR, you can create scenarios that accurately represent different conditions and actions in your test cases.
