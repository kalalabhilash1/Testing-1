To publish test reports on Tomcat, you can follow these steps:

1. Generate the test reports in a format such as HTML or XML.
2. Create a web application or use an existing one to host the test reports.
3. Copy the generated test reports to the appropriate directory within the web application's file structure.
4. Deploy the web application to Tomcat by copying the WAR file to the webapps directory.
5. Start or restart Tomcat to ensure the web application is running.
6. Access the test reports through the URL of the deployed web application.
